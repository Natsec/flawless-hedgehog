# Flawless Hedgehog
An interactive Apache server hardening script.
It is made to help securing an out-of-the-box Apache server without having to go deep inside the configuration files.
Because it is intended to add a first layer of security rapidly, it avoid making too complex changes.

## Features
You have control on every action applied to your configuration.
The script features the most common best practices that should be applied to a web server that is exposed to the Internet.

It provides:
- Hiding the Apache version on error pages
- Hiding the Apache version in HTTP response headers
- Disabling the Etag response header
